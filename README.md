# Login service

## üßê What is this?

Handle all the logins for multiple applications with a serverless graphql backend.

## Folder structure and development

This is a monorepo, so both client/server are withing the repository. You need to create a `.env` file on the root path of this repository. Make a copu from `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`. Modify the values to your settings. After doing that, you can run the server locally with:

```
  cd server && npm run dev
```

The GraphQL playground will be available on `http://localhost:3000`
