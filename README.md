## Folder structure and development

This is a monorepo, so both client/server are withing the repository. You need to create a `.env` file on the root path of this repository. Make a copy from `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`. Modify the values to your settings. After doing that, you can run the server locally with:

```
  cd server && npm run dev
```

The GraphQL playground will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

## Get Started

## 1) Deploy the login service

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a file on the root folder called `deploy-settings.json` copy this JSON object into it with your config settings

```js
{
  "mongodb": "mongodb+srv://prod:prod@prod.mongodb.net/",
  "emailHost": "pop.gmail.com",
  "emailUser": "mygmail@gmail.com",
  "emailPassword": "gmailPassword",
  "emailSender": "no-reply@myemail.com",
  "appSecret": "verySecretThing"
}
```

3. Make sure you are logged in to _Now.sh_ on your cli. Run `now whoami` and you should get a response of your username. If you are not logged in, then run `now login` and follow the steps.

4. Run `npm run deployservice`

5. Add an alias to your deployment in now with the following syntax: `loginplify.[mydomain.com]`

6. Access your graphql endpoint as: `https://loginplify.[mydomain.com]/graphql`

## Implement in a React application
