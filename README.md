## Folder structure and development

This is a monorepo, so both client/server are withing the repository. You need to create a `.env` file on the root path of this repository. Make a copy from `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`. Modify the values to your settings. After doing that, you can run the server locally with:

```
  cd server && npm run dev
```

The GraphQL playground will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

## Get Started

## 1) Deploy the login service to now.sh

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you are logged in to _Now.sh_ on your cli. Run `now whoami` and you should get a response of your username. If you are not logged in, then run `now login` and follow the steps.
3. Add the following environmental variables on now:

```
now secret add loginplify-mongodb mongodb+srv://test:test@test.mongodb.net/
now secret add loginplify-app-secret theSecretString
```

### Optional variables

If you want to enable sending emails for verify accounts or reset password, please include these secret variables. To setup using Gmail, please refer to [this guide](#Gmail)

```
now secret add loginplify-email-host pop.gmail.com
now secret add loginplify-email-user mygmail@gmail.com
now secret add loginplify-email-password gmailPassword
now secret add loginplify-email-sender no-reply@gmail.com
```

4. Deploy to now by running:

```
npm run now:deploy
```

5. Add an alias to your deployment in now with the following syntax: `loginplify.[mydomain.com]`

6. Access your graphql endpoint as: `https://loginplify.[mydomain.com]/graphql`

## Using mongo atlas as the database

In order to use Mongo atlas cluster, make sure you whitelist all upcoming IP Addresses. Please follow [this guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-whitelist/). This needs to be done to accept connections from our loginplify serverless service.

## Gmail

### Send emails from loginplify service to verify account and reset password

Loginplify uses nodemailer to send emails. If you want to setup gmail follow [this guide](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/)

## Implement in a React application

Please refer to the documentation in the [Loginplify component library](https://github.com/danielivert/login-service/tree/master/library)
